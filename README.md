# Lyst-clone

Lyst is a fashion technology company, and premium shopping app.

# About this project: üôå

This is a team project, built by us in the Construct Week - Unit 4 at Masai School.

> In this project we have tried to clone frontend of Lyst. Cart functionality has been added using browser's localstorage and Redux. Project design is responsive for all screen sizes. This project is an effort to implement learning at masai and improve our understanding of the React.
